Adjusting to local customs, food, and weather can be initially challenging, but supportive communities ensure students feel welcome. With strong academic guidance and cultural support, scholarship students can thrive in their studies, build lasting relationships, and return home or continue abroad as confident, capable professionals ready to contribute globally.'
